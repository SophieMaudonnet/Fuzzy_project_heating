    "##  Clarification About the Misunderstanding\n",
    "\n",
    "Short version: In the first version, **I misunderstood what the “heat” variable actually meant**.  \n",
    "I initially thought “heat” represented **heating power** (how strong the heater runs).  \n",
    "\n",
    "So in practice:\n",
    "- Earlier version → “how many watts should we heat with?”\n",
    "- Current version → “what temperature band should the room move toward?”\n",
    "\n",
    "Because of this semantic mismatch, the first results looked strange.  \n",
    "To fix it, I had to either remove or rewrite several rules from scratch.  \n",
    "\n",
    "I tried to explainn everything bellow here:\n",
    "\n",
    "##  Merging Rules That Actually Meant the Same Thing\n",
    "\n",
    "In the initial rule set, we had repeated patterns (different wording, same behavior):\n",
    "\n",
    "- “user feels cold → increase”\n",
    "- “temperature is cold → increase”\n",
    "- “user slightly cold + temp is low → increase”\n",
    "\n",
    "When thinking in terms of **heating power**, it made sense to write these separately.  \n",
    "But when switching to a **target temperature** interpretation, all of them reduce to:\n",
    "\n",
    "- “In this situation, choose a warmer target temperature category.”\n",
    "\n",
    "So I merged several of these similar rules into a single, more general rule.\n",
    "\n",
    "The same thing happened for **hot scenarios**:\n",
    "\n",
    "- user feels too hot  \n",
    "- temperature already too hot  \n",
    "- temperature is hot + humidity high  \n",
    "\n",
    "All of these essentially said:  \n",
    "- “Lower the setpoint.”\n",
    "\n",
    "So these also became fewer and cleaner rules.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "##  Simplifying Eco-Related Rules\n",
    "\n",
    "Old logic:\n",
    "- eco acted like “a brake on heating power”  \n",
    "- meaning: many small rules like “if eco is high → reduce power a bit.”\n",
    "\n",
    "New logic:\n",
    "- eco means “you prefer a cooler target temperature”\n",
    "- so the setpoint is simply picked one category lower.\n",
    "\n",
    "This allowed us to:\n",
    "- remove 2–3 “eco + power” combination rules\n",
    "- express the same behavior with just a couple of clear rules\n",
    "\n",
    "This simplification also reduced the total rule count.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Summary: What I removed vs. what I added\n",
    "\n",
    "**What I removed:**\n",
    "- repetitive rules that produced the same outcome  \n",
    "- power-based rules that didn’t make sense once we treat “heat” as target temperature  \n",
    "- unnecessary fine-grained variations that the MF design already covered\n",
    "\n",
    "**What I added:**\n",
    "- fewer rules but clearer logic  \n",
    "- behavior expressed directly in terms of temperature categories  \n",
    "- a rule set that actually matches the meaning of our membership functions  \n",
    "- a system that’s easier to interpret and maintain\n",
    "\n",
    "Because of all this cleanup and restructuring:  \n",
    "**the rule count went from 17 down to 14.**\n"
